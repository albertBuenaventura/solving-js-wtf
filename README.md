# Solving all my WTFs everyday on Programming using JS/TS

Tackling all JS/TS problems I encountered and how to solve it using Albert's way.  

JS is tricky and others are considering it as `Double Edged Sword` but if you put TIME and EFFORT to learn JavaScript (or, not or you must study TypeScript!!) you will appreciate how beautiful and powerful the language is.

Most of the provided solutions are in TypeScript.

* [Tricky Closure](src/closure)
* [Callback hell](src/callback-hell)
* [Promises](src/promises)
* [Abstraction](src/abstraction)
* [SOLID](src/solid)
